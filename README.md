# Weekend Challenge No. 2: jQuery Server Calculator

## Description

The jQuery Server Calculator utilizes the relationship between Node, JS, and jQuery to calculate math equations via user input. The project primarily works by relaying data between the client.js and server.js files to generate the desired outcome. Using the DOM, the user keys in the desired first and second numbers within the two input fields, then selects a mathematical operator. This is done in the client. The data is then sent to the server, where a conditional is run to determine the proper math to be done. The server then sends the data back to the client, where it is displayed on the DOM for the user to see. A clear history of previous calculations is displayed below the mathematical outcome of the most recent input.
